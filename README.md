## Project Overview
This project is a static restaurant menu web page showing a cafe's breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. It uses HTML and CSS to organize menu items and implement a visually appealing layout for users. The page is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for better user experience.


## Features 
* Responsive design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
* Navigation: Users can view different meal sections (breakfast, lunch, dinner) by clicking links, revealing relevant menu items.
* Styled layout: Includes background images, custom fonts, and neatly arranged menu items with images, names, prices, and ingredients.

## Technologies Used

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Run index.html in your browser to view the restaurant menu.

## Usage
